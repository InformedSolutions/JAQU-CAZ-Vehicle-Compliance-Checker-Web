        The Clean Air Zone (CAZ) Vehicle Checker is operated by the Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU),
        a team  established jointly between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
        (Defra) and the Department for Transport (DfT).
      %p
        The purpose of the Vehicle Checker is to enable you to find out if you need to pay to enter a
        CAZ and, if so, how much.
      %p
        To use the Vehicle Checker, you need to enter a vehicle registration mark (VRM). JAQU treats
        VRMs as personal data because DVLA, which is an executive agency of DfT, is able to identify
        registered keepers from VRMs. However, the VRM you enter will only be retained in the Vehicle
        Checker for 24 hours after your enquiry has been answered and will not be accessible in any
        way by JAQU, DfT and Defra, or shared with any other organisation.
        If the Vehicle Checker is unable to determine the compliance of your vehicle (you will receive
        an ‘Unable to determine compliance’ error), then the Vehicle Checker will retain your VRM for
        30 days.  This allows the Vehicle Checker Support Team to diagnose what has gone wrong and to
        help improve the service.
      %p
        Additional vehicle data has been requested and supplied by motor manufacturers for vehicles
        that could be determined as an ‘early adopter’ of a compliant Euro Emission standard. This
        will support the service to correctly determine a vehicle’s compliance.
      %p
        You can raise any queries about the information provided by the Vehicle Checker by completing
        the webform on the Vehicle Checker website.   Along with your query, you will need to give
        your name and email address, which will be used to respond to you. Information, including
        your name and email address, that you send using the webform will not be kept by the Vehicle
        Checker, but Gov.Notify will send the information to JAQU, or another organisation acting on
        JAQU’s behalf, to respond to you. Your personal information will be kept for no longer than
        a year and then deleted.
      %p
        The processing of personal data in the Vehicle Checker is necessary for the performance of a
        task carried out in the exercise of official authority vested in both DfT and Defra, as
        partners in JAQU.
      %p
        If you have any questions about how your personal data is processed by the CAZ Vehicle
        Checker, or are interested in exercising any of your rights in relation to that processing,
        please contact:
