        The Drive in a Clean Air Zone (CAZ) service is operated by the Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU),
        a team established jointly between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra)
        and the Department for Transport (DfT).
      %p
        The purpose of the Drive in a Clean Air Zone charge service is to enable you to find out
        if you need to pay to drive within a CAZ and, if so, pay a daily charge if your vehicle
        does not meet emission standards. The service has three components:

        Check if you’ll be charged to drive in a Clean Air Zone
      %p
        The purpose of the Check if you’ll be charged to drive in a Clean Air Zone service
        is to enable you to find out if you need to pay to drive in a CAZ and, if so, how much.
      %p
        To use the service, you need to enter a number plate (registration number).
        JAQU treats a number plate as personal data because the Driver & Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA)
        which is an executive agency of DfT, is able to identify vehicle information and the
        registered keeper from the number plate. However, the number plate you enter will only be retained
        for 24 hours after your enquiry has been answered and will not be accessible in any way by JAQU,
        DfT and Defra, or shared with any other organisation.
      %p
        If the service is unable to determine the compliance of your vehicle (you will receive an
        ‘Unable to determine compliance’ error), then the service will retain your number plate for up to 30 days.
        This allows the Support Team to diagnose what has gone wrong and to help improve the service.
      %p
        Additional vehicle data has been requested and supplied by motor manufacturers
        for vehicles that could be determined as an ’early adopter’ of a compliant Euro
        Emission standard. This will support the service to correctly determine a
        vehicle’s compliance.
      %h1.govuk-heading-xl
        Pay a charge for a single vehicle
      %p
        The purpose of the Pay a charge for a single vehicle service is to enable you to
        pay a daily charge for driving in a CAZ, if your vehicle does not meet emission
        standards. You need to pay separately for each CAZ you drive through.
      %p
        To use the service you need to enter a number plate (registration number).
        JAQU treats a number plate as personal data because the DVLA is able to
        identify vehicle information and the registered keeper from the number plate.
        If the service is unable to determine the compliance of your vehicle (you will
        receive an ‘Unable to determine compliance’ error), then the service will retain
        your number plate for up to 30 days. This allows the Support Team to diagnose
        what has gone wrong and to help improve the service.
      %p
        You can pay using a credit or debit card. To make the payment, you will enter your card details
        and the payment data will be only processed by the service (using GOV.UK Pay acting on behalf of JAQU,
        who will store the payment transaction). Payment date is exchanged with the central service which
        will not be stored. An email address will be requested from the user to allow a payment transaction
        receipt to be sent by GOV.UK Notify. The local authority that is responsible for the CAZ you use
        will be sent confirmation of the payment including the vehicle number plate that has been paid for.
        The email data is retained on the GOV.UK Notify platform for a period of 7 days and then deleted.
      %p
        We retain your payment transactions for a period of 7 years in our system. These include
        a record of the number plate against which the payment is made.
      %p
        The central Drive in a Clean Air Zone service has no control over how the local authority
        uses the information exchanged in the above scenarios and the data retention policies they apply.

      %h1.govuk-heading-xl
        Check and pay for multiple vehicles
      %p
        The purpose of the Check and pay for multiple vehicles service is to allow account users
        with 2 or more vehicles to create a company account to upload and pay charges for multiple
        UK registered vehicles; they will only pay for the vehicles that do not meet the emission standards.
      %p
        To use the service you will need to create an account with a company name stating your company name,
        email address and a password which is created and supplied by the user.
        The central service will verify the email address to send a secure link via GOV.UK Notify
        to complete the account set up. The account information will be retained by us as long
        as the account remains active. If you do not use our service for 180 days, your account will
        become inactive. In this scenario, we will retain your account information for a period
        of 7 years after the account becomes inactive.
      %p
        You will need to enter or upload a number plate(s) (registration number) for your vehicle(s).
        JAQU treats a number plate as personal data because the DVLA is able to identify vehicle
        information and the registered keeper from the number plate. The active number plate(s)
        will be retained in our database as long as your account remains active. We maintain a history
        of your vehicle number plate(s) when you replace your vehicle(s) through a spreadsheet upload.
        We retain the history of your vehicle(s) for a period of 12 months after which these will be deleted.
      %p
        If the service is unable to determine the compliance for one or more of your vehicles,
        then the service will retain your number plate for up to 30 days. This allows us to diagnose
        what has gone wrong and to help improve the service.

        Users will need to pay separately for each CAZ they drive in.
        You can pay using a credit or debit card. You can enter your credit or debit card details to make payment;
        your payment data will be processed by the service (using GOV.UK Pay acting on behalf of JAQU,

        The payment information in the central service is matched with the ANPR feed from local authorities to exchange payment status.

        Early Notice Letters (ENLs)
      %p
        Clean Air Zone local authorities, Defra and DfT (as JAQU) are Joint Controllers,
        which means that they jointly use personal data to ensure that people, who are likely to be
        affected by the introduction of Clean Air Zones, receive a letter giving sufficient
        advance notice of the zones coming into place. These letters are called ‘Early Notice Letters’.
      %p
        The relevant Clean Air Zone local authority, JAQU and DVLA will receive and use your personal data
        for the purpose of sending the Early Notice Letter to you.
      %p
        Your personal data that will be processed are:
        %ul.govuk-list-govuk-list--bullet

            %p
              the number plate (also known as a vehicle registration mark) of your vehicle,

              and, in some cases as explained below, your name and address
      %p
        If your vehicle travels in a Clean Air Zone, the local authority’s automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)
        cameras covering that Zone will record your number plate, which the local authority will pass to JAQU
        so that JAQU can determine whether your vehicle meets current emission standards.
        If your vehicle does not meet these emission standards, DVLA will use your name and address
        held in their records with your vehicle number plate to send you a letter, on behalf of the local authority,
        informing you that you will likely have to pay a charge if your vehicle travels in that area after Clean Air Zone charging starts.
      %p
        The legal basis for the processing (use) of your personal data is that the use of your personal data is necessary
        for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
      %p
        The task in the public interest is to inform people of new regulations and penalties prior to their coming into effect.
        This relates to monitoring and identifying contraventions of Part III and Schedule 12 of the Transport Act 2000 and
        Parts 2 and 6 of The Road User Charging Schemes (Penalty Charges, Adjudication and Enforcement) (England)
        Regulations 2013 pertaining to the Clean Air Zone Charging Order relevant to the local authority
        whose ANPR cameras recorded your number plate.
      %p
        JAQU and the DVLA will not keep your personal data for the purpose of sending the Early Notice Letter
        after that letter has been sent to you.
