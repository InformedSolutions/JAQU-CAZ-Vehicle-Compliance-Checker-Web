        The Clean Air Zone (CAZ) Vehicle Checker is operated by the Joint Air Quality Unit (JAQU),
        a team  established jointly between the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs
        (Defra) and the Department for Transport (DfT).
      %p
        The purpose of the Vehicle Checker is to enable you to find out if you need to pay to enter a
        CAZ and, if so, how much.
      %p
        To use the Vehicle Checker, you need to enter a vehicle registration mark (VRM). JAQU treats
        VRMs as personal data because DVLA, which is an executive agency of DfT, is able to identify
        registered keepers from VRMs. However, the VRM you enter will only be retained in the Vehicle
        Checker for 24 hours after your enquiry has been answered and will not be accessible in any
        way by JAQU, DfT and Defra, or shared with any other organisation.
        If the Vehicle Checker is unable to determine the compliance of your vehicle (you will receive
        an ‘Unable to determine compliance’ error), then the Vehicle Checker will retain your VRM for
        30 days.  This allows the Vehicle Checker Support Team to diagnose what has gone wrong and to
        help improve the service.
      %p
        Additional vehicle data has been requested and supplied by motor manufacturers for vehicles
        that could be determined as an ‘early adopter’ of a compliant Euro Emission standard. This
        will support the service to correctly determine a vehicle’s compliance.
      %p
        You can raise any queries about the information provided by the Vehicle Checker by completing
        the webform on the Vehicle Checker website.   Along with your query, you will need to give
        your name and email address, which will be used to respond to you. Information, including
        your name and email address, that you send using the webform will not be kept by the Vehicle
        Checker, but Gov.Notify will send the information to JAQU, or another organisation acting on
        JAQU’s behalf, to respond to you. Your personal information will be kept for no longer than
        a year and then deleted.
      %p
        The processing of personal data in the Vehicle Checker is necessary for the performance of a
        task carried out in the exercise of official authority vested in both DfT and Defra, as
        partners in JAQU.
      %p
        If you have any questions about how your personal data is processed by the CAZ Vehicle
        Checker, or are interested in exercising any of your rights in relation to that processing,

        Early Notice Letters (ENLs)
      %p
        Clean Air Zone local authorities, Defra and DfT (as JAQU) are Joint Controllers,
        which means that they jointly use personal data to ensure that people, who are likely to be
        affected by the introduction of Clean Air Zones, receive a letter giving sufficient
        advance notice of the zones coming into place. These letters are called ’Early Notice Letters’.
      %p
        The relevant Clean Air Zone local authority, JAQU and DVLA will receive and use your personal data
        for the purpose of sending the Early Notice Letter to you.
      %p
        Your personal data that will be processed are:

              and, in some cases as explained below, your name and address
      %p
        If your vehicle travels in a Clean Air Zone, the local authority’s automatic number plate recognition (ANPR)
        cameras covering that Zone will record your number plate, which the local authority will pass to JAQU
        so that JAQU can determine whether your vehicle meets current emission standards.
        If your vehicle does not meet these emission standards, DVLA will use your name and address
        held in their records with your vehicle number plate to send you a letter, on behalf of the local authority,
        informing you that you will likely have to pay a charge if your vehicle travels in that area after Clean Air Zone charging starts.
      %p
        The legal basis for the processing (use) of your personal data is that the use of your personal data is necessary
        for the performance of a task carried out in the public interest.
      %p
        The task in the public interest is to inform people of new regulations and penalties prior to their coming into effect.
        This relates to monitoring and identifying contraventions of Part III and Schedule 12 of the Transport Act 2000 and
        Parts 2 and 6 of The Road User Charging Schemes (Penalty Charges, Adjudication and Enforcement) (England)
        Regulations 2013 pertaining to the Clean Air Zone Charging Order relevant to the local authority
        whose ANPR cameras recorded your number plate.
      %p
        JAQU and the DVLA will not keep your personal data for the purpose of sending the Early Notice Letter
        after that letter has been sent to you.
