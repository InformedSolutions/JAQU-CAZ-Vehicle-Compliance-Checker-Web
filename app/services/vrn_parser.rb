# frozen_string_literal: true

##
# This class parses VRN according to included in the
# {task}[https://eaflood.atlassian.net/browse/VCCS-131] business rules.
#
# ==== Examples
#
# * A9 -> \--A\--9
# * 9AA -> 0009-AA
# See specs or business rules for more examples.
#
# ==== Usage
#
# The service should be called using {BaseService class level method "call"}[rdoc-ref:BaseService::call]
#
#    VrnParser.call(vrn: 'CU1234')
class VrnParser < BaseService
  ##
  # The initialization method for the service
  # ==== Attributes
  #
  # * +vrn+ - an unparsed vehicle registration number submitted by the user
  def initialize(vrn:)
    @vrn = vrn.upcase
    @result = ''
    @group = []
  end

  ##
  # The caller method for the service.
  # It invokes parsing on the submitted VRN.
  #
  # It returns parsed VRN.
  # ==== Parsing logic
  #
  # VRN is split into characters and get processed one by one.
  #
  # In the first step, characters are put into a temporary group if the group is empty or
  # the character is the same type (number or letter) as the previous one.
  # If not, the group is summarized by prepending dashes or zeros and pushed into the result.
  # The new group is initialized with the current character.
  #
  # In the next step, additional dashes are prepended to the last group,
  # and the group is merged with the result.
  # Then, up to 7 characters are taken as a final result.
  def call
    return vrn if vrn.length > 6
